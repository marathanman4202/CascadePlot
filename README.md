Code to generate cascade plots plus bottom and side strip charts from csv files of daily long-term data.  The scripts are based on a more specific application for the Willamette Water 2100 project at Oregon State University (http://water.oregonstate.edu/ww2100/).

The scripts may be reproduced and used as you like.  If you find them useful, please reference as follows.
